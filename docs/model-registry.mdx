## Model Tags

Cortex is compatible with 3rd party model hubs like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co).

Cortex has a selection of preconfigured models across `GGUF`, `ONNX`, and `TensorRT-LLM` formats. 

The available model variants, across sizes, formats, and quantizations, are stored in each repo's branches.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem  value="GGUF" label="GGUF" default>
    ```bash 
    cortex models pull llama3
    cortex models pull llama3:gguf
    cortex models pull llama3:8B-gguf
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ONNX" label="ONNX">
    ```bash 
    cortex models pull llama3:onnx
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TensorRT-LLM" label="TensorRT-LLM">
    
    TensorRT-LLM engines are specific to the hardware you are running on.

    ```bash 
    cortex models pull 8B-tensorrtllm-linux-ada
    cortex models pull tensorrtllm-windows-ada
    ```
