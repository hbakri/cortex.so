[Cortex Model Repos](https://huggingface.co/cortexso) are Cortex's built-in models hosted on Huggingface, which uses a single Git repository to hold different versions of a model, which can be pulled using Docker or Ollama-like syntax.

:::info
We also plan to provide alternative hosting locations or servers to replicate the content, ensuring access in regions where HuggingFace is blocked or has slow download speeds.
::: 

## Why HuggingFace?
Cortex Model Repos are hosted on Huggingface for several reasons:
- **Tag-Based Formats**: Inspired by Docker and Ollama, Cortex Model Repos uses a tag-based format (`model:version`) that simplifies managing multiple versions and formats of a model.
- **Git and Git-LFS Based**: Using Git and Git-LFS makes mirroring and version control easy. Huggingface supports this setup, aiding in model management and distribution.
- **Mirror-Friendly Setup**: If Huggingface is blocked or slow, users can pull from alternative mirrors like Gitlab or Gitea, ensuring consistent access.
- **Self-Hosting and Mirroring**: Users can host their own Git repository, push updates to Huggingface, and create mirrors for better accessibility.

## Usage
Download a built-in model from the [Cortex Model Repos](https://huggingface.co/cortexso) using a `model_id`. You can obtain the `model_id` from the Cortex model repository or the model's specific branch.
```bash
# Download the default mistral model from: https://huggingface.co/cortexso/mistral/tree/main
cortex pull mistral

# Init the ONNX engine in Cortex
cortex engines onnx init
# Download an ONNX version of the mistral model from: https://huggingface.co/cortexso/mistral/tree/onnx
cortex pull mistral:onnx

# Init the TensorRT-LLM engine in Cortex
cortex engines tensorrt-llm init
# Download a TensorRT-LLM version of the mistral model from: https://huggingface.co/cortexso/mistral/tree/tensorrt-llm-linux-ada
cortex pull mistral:tensorrt-llm-linux-ada

# Download a 7B version of the mistral model from: https://huggingface.co/cortexso/mistral/tree/7b-gguf
cortex pull mistral:7b-gguf
```
