title: Hugging Face
description: Cortex supports all `GGUF` and `ONNX` models available in Huggingface repositories, providing access to a wide range of models.
---

:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::


Cortex supports all `GGUF` and `ONNX` models from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co), along with its built-in models. For `TensorRT-LLM` models, only built-in models in the [Cortex Model Repos](/docs/hub/cortex-hub) are supported.

:::info
To pull a supported model from HuggingFace, use the format `ORG_ID/MODEL_ID`.
:::
## GGUF
![HF GGUF](/img/docs/gguf.png)
To view all available `GGUF` models on HuggingFace, select the `GGUF` tag in the Libraries section.
```bash 
# Pull the Codestral-22B-v0.1-GGUF model from the bartowski organization
cortex pull bartowski/Codestral-22B-v0.1-GGUF

# Pull the gemma-7b model from the google organization
cortex pull google/gemma-7b

```

## ONNX
![HF ONNX](/img/docs/onnx.png)
To view all available `ONNX` models on HuggingFace, select the `ONNX` tag in the Libraries section.
```bash
# Pull the XLM-Roberta-Large-Vit-B-16Plus model from the immich-app organization
cortex pull immich-app/XLM-Roberta-Large-Vit-B-16Plus

# Pull the mt0-base model from the bigscience organization
cortex pull bigscience/mt0-base


```

## TensorRT-LLM
We are still working to support all available `TensorRT-LLM` models on HuggingFace. For now, Cortex only supports built-in `TensorRT-LLM` models, which can be downloaded from the [Cortex Model Repos](/docs/hub/cortex-hub).
