:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is under construction.
:::
Cortex uses `llama.cpp` as the default engine by default the `GGUF` format is supported by Cortex.

## Run Model
```bash
## To ensure you have the dependencies installed correctly
cortex engines llamacpp init

## Run a GGUF model
cortex run mistral:7b-gguf
```
## Example `yaml`
```yaml
name: mistral
model: mistral:7B
version: 1

# Results Preferences
stop:
  - </s>
top_p: 0.95
temperature: 0.7
frequency_penalty: 0
presence_penalty: 0
max_tokens: 4096 # Infer from base config.json -> max_position_embeddings
stream: true # true | false

# Engine / Model Settings
ngl: 33 # Infer from base config.json -> num_attention_heads
ctx_len: 4096 # Infer from base config.json -> max_position_embeddings
engine: cortex.llamacpp
prompt_template: "{system_message} [INST] {prompt} [/INST]"

```
## Model Parameters

| **Parameter**          | **Description**                                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `top_p`                | The cumulative probability threshold for token sampling.                             |
| `temperature`          | Controls the randomness of predictions by scaling logits before applying softmax.    |
| `frequency_penalty`    | Penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the sequence so far.       |
| `presence_penalty`     | Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the sequence so far.            |
| `max_tokens`           | Maximum number of tokens in the output; inferred from base config.json.              |
| `stream`               | Enables or disables streaming mode for the output (true or false).                   |
| `ngl`                  | Number of attention heads; inferred from base config.json.                           |
| `ctx_len`              | Context length (maximum number of tokens). Inferred from base config.json.           |
| `engine`               | Specifies the engine to be used for model execution.         |
| `prompt_template`      | Template for formatting the prompt, including system messages and instructions.      |
