title: GGUF
description: GGUF Model Format.
---

:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

Cortex uses `llama.cpp` as the default engine by default the `GGUF` format is supported by Cortex.

:::info
Cortex automatically generates any `GGUF` model from the HuggingFace repo that does not have the `model.yaml` file.
:::

## Run Model
```bash
## Run a GGUF model
cortex run openhermes-2.5:7b-gguf
```
## [`model.yaml`](/docs/model-yaml) Sample
```yaml
name: openhermes-2.5
model: openhermes-2.5:7B
version: 1

# Engine / Model Settings
engine: cortex.llamacpp
ngl: 33 # Infer from base config.json -> num_attention_heads
ctx_len: 4096 # Infer from base config.json -> max_position_embeddings
prompt_template: "<|im_start|>system\n{system_message}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n{prompt}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"

# Results Preferences
stop:
  - </s>
top_p: 0.95
temperature: 0.7
frequency_penalty: 0
presence_penalty: 0
max_tokens: 4096 # Infer from base config.json -> max_position_embeddings
stream: true # true | false

```
## Model Parameters
| **Parameter**          | **Description**                                                                      | **Required** |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `top_p`                | The cumulative probability threshold for token sampling.                             | No  |
| `temperature`          | Controls the randomness of predictions by scaling logits before applying softmax.    | No   |
| `frequency_penalty`    | Penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the sequence so far.       | No   |
| `presence_penalty`     | Penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the sequence so far.            | No   |
| `max_tokens`           | Maximum number of tokens in the output.                                              | Yes          |
| `stream`               | Enables or disables streaming mode for the output (true or false).                   | Yes          |
| `ngl`                  | Number of attention heads.                                                           | Yes          |
| `ctx_len`              | Context length (maximum number of tokens).                                           | Yes          |
| `engine`               | Specifies the engine to be used for model execution.                                 | Yes          |
| `prompt_template`      | Template for formatting the prompt, including system messages and instructions.      | Yes          |
| `stop`                 | Specifies the stopping condition for the model, which can be a word, a letter, or a specific text. | Yes          |
