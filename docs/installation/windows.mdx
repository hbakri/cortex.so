:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

## Overview
For Windows, Cortex can be installed in two ways:
- [Windows](#windows)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](#windows-subsystem-linux)

## Windows
### Install Cortex
Before installation, make sure that you have met the required [dependencies](#windows) and [hardware](#hardware) to run Cortex.
```sh
winget install cortex.cpp
```
#### Data Folder
By default, CortexCPP is installed in the following directory:
```
# Binary Location
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\cortexcpp

# Application Data (Engines, Models and Logs folders)
C:\Users\<username>\.cortexcpp
```
### Uninstall Cortex
```sh
winget uninstall cortex.cpp
```
:::info
Delete the Cortex data folder located in your home folder.
:::
## Windows Subsystem Linux
:::info
Windows Subsystem Linux allows running Linux tools and workflows seamlessly alongside Windows applications. For more information, please see this [article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).

brew install cortex.cpp

# Install using Sudo
sudo apt install cortex.cpp
```
#### Data Folder
By default, CortexCPP is installed in the following directory:
```
# Binary Location
/usr/bin/cortexcpp

# Application Data (Engines, Models and Logs folders)
/home/<username>/.cortexcpp
```
### Uninstall Cortex

## Build from Source

1. Clone the Cortex repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex/tree/dev).
2. Navigate to the `cortex-js` folder.
3. Open the terminal and run the following command to build the Cortex project:

```sh
npx nest build
```

4. Make the `command.js` executable:

```sh
node "[path-to]\cortex\cortex-js\dist\src\command.js"
```

5. Link the package globally:

```sh
npm link
```
6. Verify that Cortex is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```

## Prerequisites
### Dependencies
#### Windows
- Node.js version 18 and higher
- NPM
#### Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Node.js version 18 and higher
- NPM
- Homebrew
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu)
- OpenMPI

### Hardware
#### Operating System
- Windows 10 or higher.
#### CPU
:::info
- Cortex supports a processor that can handle AVX2. For the full list, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#CPUs_with_AVX2).
- We support older processors with AVX and AVX-512, though this is not recommended.
:::
##### Intel CPU
- Haswell processors (Q2 2013) and newer.
- Tiger Lake (Q3 2020) and newer for Celeron and Pentium processors.
##### AMD CPU
- Excavator processors (Q2 2015) and newer.
#### RAM
:::info
We support DDR2 RAM as the minimum requirement but recommend using newer generations of RAM for improved performance.
:::
- 8GB for running up to 3B models (int4).
- 16GB for running up to 7B models (int4).
- 32GB for running up to 13B models (int4).
#### GPU
:::info
Having at least 6GB VRAM when using NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel Arc GPUs is recommended.
:::
- 6GB can load the 3B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 8GB can load the 7B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 12GB can load the 13B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
:::info
- [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) version 470.63.01 or higher.
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) version 12.3 or higher.
:::
#### Disk
- At least 10GB for app storage and model download.
