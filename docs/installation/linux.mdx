## Cortex Installation

### Step 1: Install Cortex

:::info
You can also install Cortex using the Cortex Installer available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/janhq/cortex/releases).
:::

```sh
# Install globally on your system
npm i -g cortexso

# Install using Brew
brew install cortexso
```
:::info
Cortex automatically detects your CPU and GPU, downloading the appropriate CPU instruction sets and required dependencies to optimize GPU performance.
:::

### Step 2: Verify the Installation

1. After installation, you can verify that Cortex is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```
2. Cortex is ready to use!

2. Navigate to the `cortex-js` folder.
3. Open the terminal and run the following command to build the Cortex project:

```sh
npx nest build
```

4. Make the `command.js` executable:

```sh
chmod +x '[path-to]/cortex/cortex-js/dist/src/command.js'
```

5. Link the package globally:
