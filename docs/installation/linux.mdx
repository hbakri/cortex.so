:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

## Cortex.cpp Installation
Before installation, make sure that you have met the required [dependencies](#dependencies) and [hardware](#hardware) to run Cortex.

```sh
sudo apt install cortex.cpp
```
:::info
You can also install Cortex.cpp using the Cortex Installer available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/janhq/cortex/releases).
:::
### Data Folder
By default, Cortex.cpp is installed in the following directory:
```
# Binary Location
/usr/bin/cortexcpp<env>

# Application Data (Engines, Models and Logs folders)
/home/<username>/.cortexcpp<env>
```
## Uninstall Cortex.cpp
```sh
sudo apt remove cortex.cpp
```
:::info
Delete the Cortex.cpp data folder located in your home folder.
:::

## Build from Source

1. Clone the Cortex.cpp repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp).
2. Navigate to the `engine > vcpkg` folder.
3. Configure the vpkg:

```bash
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
vcpkg install
```
4. Build the Cortex.cpp inside the `build` folder:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_vcpkg_folder/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static
```
5. Use Visual Studio with the C++ development kit to build the project using the files generated in the `build` folder.
6. Verify that Cortex.cpp is installed correctly by getting help information.

```sh
# Get the help information
cortex -h
```

## Prerequisites
### Dependencies
- Node.js version 18 and higher
- NPM
- Homebrew
- OpenMPI

### Hardware
#### Operating System
- Debian-based (Supports `.deb` and `AppImage` )
- Ubuntu version 22.04 and higher
#### CPU
:::info
- Cortex.cpp supports a processor that can handle AVX2. For the full list, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#CPUs_with_AVX2).
- We support older processors with AVX and AVX-512, though this is not recommended.
:::
##### Intel CPU
- Haswell processors (Q2 2013) and newer.
- Tiger Lake (Q3 2020) and newer for Celeron and Pentium processors.
##### AMD CPU
- Excavator processors (Q2 2015) and newer.
#### RAM
:::info
We support DDR2 RAM as the minimum requirement but recommend using newer generations of RAM for improved performance.
:::
- 8GB for running up to 3B models (int4).
- 16GB for running up to 7B models (int4).
- 32GB for running up to 13B models (int4).
#### GPU
:::info
Having at least 6GB VRAM when using NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel Arc GPUs is recommended.
:::
- 6GB can load the 3B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 8GB can load the 7B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
- 12GB can load the 13B model (int4) with `ngl` at 120 ~ full speed on CPU/ GPU.
:::info
- [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) version 470.63.01 or higher.
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) version 12.3 or higher.
:::
#### Disk
- At least 10GB for app storage and model download.
