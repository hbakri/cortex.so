:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex.cpp is currently under development. Our documentation outlines the intended behavior of Cortex, which may not yet be fully implemented in the codebase.
:::

When you install Cortex.cpp, three types of files will be generated on your device:

- **Binary Files**
- **Configuration Files**
- **Data Folder**

## Binary Files
These are the executable files of the Cortex.cpp application. The file format varies depending on the operating system:

- **Windows**: `.exe` located at `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\cortexcpp\cortex<env>.exe`
- **Linux**: `.deb` or `.fedora` located at `/usr/bin/cortexcpp<env>`
- **macOS**: `.pkg` located at `/usr/local/bin/cortexcpp<env>`

## Configuration Files
These files store the settings and preferences of the Cortex.cpp application. The configuration file is named `.cortexrc` and is stored in the following locations:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.cortexrc<env>`
- **Linux**: `/home/<username>/.cortexrc<env>`
- **macOS**: `/Users/<username>/.cortexrc<env>`

## Cortex.cpp Data Folder
The data folder stores the engines, models, and logs required by Cortex.cpp. This folder is located at:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.cortexcpp<env>`
- **Linux**: `/home/<username>/.cortexcpp<env>`
- **macOS**: `/Users/<username>\.cortexcpp<env>`

### Folder Structure
The Cortex.cpp data folder typically follows this structure:

```yaml
~/.cortexcpp<env>
  â”œâ”€â”€ models/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ model_id.yaml
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ model_id
  â”‚       â””â”€â”€ model_id.yaml
  â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logs.txt
  â””â”€â”€ engines/
      â””â”€â”€ llamacpp
```
#### `.cortexcpp<env>`
The main directory that stores all Cortex-related files, located in the user's home directory.
#### `models/`
Contains the AI models used by Cortex for processing and generating responses.
#### `logs/`
Stores log files, which are useful for troubleshooting and monitoring the application's performance.
#### `engines/`
Stores the necessary dependencies and engine files needed to run Cortex on supported engines.
