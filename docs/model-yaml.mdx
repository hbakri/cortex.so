:::warning
ðŸš§ Cortex is under construction.
:::

Cortex automates model execution using parameters specified in the `model.yaml` file, which contains required runtime parameters and model settings. This flat, portable configuration file instructs Cortex on how to run the models.
:::info
Cortex requires a `model.yaml` file to run models. If a `model.yaml` file is not available, Cortex automatically generates one from the model metadata using default values.

## Model Presets

Model presets are saved `model.yaml` files that serve as templates for pre-configured model settings. These presets are designed to ensure optimal performance with the specified engine.
These presets are not restricted to specific models. You can apply the presets to any model or any engine runtime.
