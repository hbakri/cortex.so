## Model Presets

Model presets are saved `model.yaml` files that serve as templates for pre-configured model settings. These presets are designed to ensure optimal performance with the specified engine.
These presets are not restricted to specific models. You can apply the presets to any model or any engine runtime.

:::info
Model presets override the values of the `model.yaml`. If presets are available, Cortex uses them. Otherwise, it defaults to `model.yaml` values.
