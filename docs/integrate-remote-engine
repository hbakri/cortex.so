This document provides a step-by-step guide to adding a new engine to the Cortex codebase, similar to the `OpenAIEngineExtension`.
:::

## Steps to Add a New Engine

### 1. Create a New Engine Extension File

- Navigate to the `cortex-js/src/extensions` directory.
- Create a new file named `<new-engine>.engine.ts` (replace `<new-engine>` with the name of your engine).

### 2. Implement the New Engine Extension Class

Use the following template to implement your new engine extension class. Replace placeholders with appropriate values for your engine.

```typescript
class <NewEngine>EngineExtension extends OAIEngineExtension {
  apiUrl = 'https://api.<new-engine>.com/v1/chat/completions';
  name = '<new-engine>';
  productName = '<New Engine> Inference Engine';
  description = 'This extension enables <New Engine> chat completion API calls';
  version = '0.0.1';
  apiKey?: string;
}
```

### 3. Register the New Engine

1. **Open** `cortex-js/src/extensions/extensions.module.ts`.

2. **Register your new engine in the provider array:**

```typescript
[
    new OpenAIEngineExtension(httpService, configUsecases, eventEmitter),
    //... other remote engines
    new <NewEngine>EngineExtension(httpService, configUsecases, eventEmitter),
]
```

## Explanation of Key Properties and Methods

### `apiUrl`
This is the URL endpoint for the new engine's API. It is used to make chat completion requests. 

### `name`
This is a unique identifier for the engine. It is used internally to reference the engine. 

### `productName`
This is a human-readable name for the engine. It is used for display purposes. 

### `description`
This provides a brief description of what the engine does. It is used for documentation and display purposes. 

### `version`
This indicates the version of the engine extension. It is used for version control and display purposes. 

### `eventEmmitter.on('config.updated')`
This is an event listener that listens for configuration updates. When the configuration for the engine is updated, this listener updates the `apiKey` and the engine's status. 

### `onLoad`
This method is called when the engine extension is loaded. It retrieves the engine's configuration (such as the `apiKey`) and sets the engine's status based on whether the `apiKey` is available. 

## Advanced: Transforming Payloads and Responses

Some engines require custom transformations for the payload sent to the API and the response received from the API. This is achieved using the `transformPayload` and `transformResponse` methods. These methods allow you to modify the data structure to match the specific requirements of the engine.

### `transformPayload`

The `transformPayload` method is used to transform the data before sending it to the engine's API. This method takes the original payload and modifies it as needed.

**Example: Anthropic Engine**

In the Anthropic Engine, the `transformPayload` method extracts the system message and other messages, and includes additional parameters like `model`, `stream`, and `max_tokens`.

### `transformResponse`

The `transformResponse` method is used to transform the data received from the engine's API. This method processes the response and converts it into a format that the application can use.

**Example: Anthropic Engine**

In the Anthropic Engine, the `transformResponse` method handles both stream and non-stream responses. It processes the response data and converts it into a standardized format.
